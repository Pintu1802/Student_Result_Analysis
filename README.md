# Student_Result_Analysis

Overview:

To perform student result analysis based on scores, you can use Python along with libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization. Here's a simple example to get you started:

Collecting Data: First, collect the student scores. You can either input them manually or load them from a file/database.

Data Analysis: Use Pandas to analyze the data. Calculate basic statistics like mean, median, mode, and standard deviation to understand the distribution of scores.

Data Visualization: Use Matplotlib or other visualization libraries to create histograms, box plots, or scatter plots to visualize the distribution of scores and identify any patterns or outliers.
